# Resources for learning R

## R for Data Science

Hadley Wickham & Garret Grolemund

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html

A free textbook that starts from the basics of R and goes into some of the 
tools that make it a full programming language. It is assumed that the reader 
may be learning their first programming language, so there are tips on good 
coding practice. Emphasis on sections 17-21, which focus on the programming 
aspect, rather than the data-manipulation side of R.

## Advanced R

Hadley Wickham

https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html

A free textbook that gets into the intracacies of R. A good step after "R for 
Data Science", and a go-to for those coming to R from other programming 
languages.

## Profvis

A tool for measuring performance of R code. Would be useful for functions 
that need to be run thousands of times, or over very large corpora.
